\indent This report documents the comprehensive work undertaken during my final-year internship at VOID Digital Agency, a prominent independent UX and digital solutions firm in Morocco. The internship focused on two primary objectives: the implementation of an advanced CI/CD pipeline and the development of an innovative Intern Management Platform.\\[0.5em]

\indent The CI/CD pipeline implementation leveraged modern DevOps practices, including Docker containerization, resulting in a 60\% reduction in deployment time and enhanced development workflow efficiency. The Intern Management Platform, built on a headless Drupal architecture with React/Next.js frontend, introduced a sophisticated solution for managing intern applications, onboarding processes, and performance tracking.\\[0.5em]

\indent The technical stack encompassed PHP, Docker, React, and Next.js, demonstrating the integration of modern web technologies with robust development practices.\\[0.5em]

\indent The project faced several technical challenges, including container networking complexities, test reliability issues, and headless CMS integration hurdles. These challenges were systematically addressed through innovative solutions and best practices.
