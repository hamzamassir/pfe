\section{Introduction}
\noindent
In today's fast-paced digital economy, organizations must deliver \textbf{seamless}, \textbf{scalable}, and \textbf{engaging} web experiences to stay ahead. \textbf{VOID Digital Agency}, established in 2005, has become a recognized leader in \textbf{user experience} and \textbf{digital solutions} for banking, healthcare, telecom, retail, and cultural clients.

\medskip

\noindent
During my final-year internship at \textbf{VOID}, I undertook two parallel streams of work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core Project:} Design and implementation of a \textbf{CI/CD pipeline} alongside a headless-Drupal-based \textbf{Intern Management Platform}, automating build-test-deploy workflows and centralizing trainee onboarding, progress tracking, and reporting.
  \item \textbf{Side Projects:} Infrastructure enhancements, including server migrations from production to test environments, building custom \textbf{PHP-FPM Docker images}, and developing an automated dependency-update tool integrated into the CI/CD workflow.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\noindent
By embedding these initiatives within \textbf{VOID's} agile framework, this report demonstrates how modern DevOps practices and decoupled architectures can drive both \textbf{efficiency} and \textbf{quality}, delivering robust, maintainable digital solutions.
