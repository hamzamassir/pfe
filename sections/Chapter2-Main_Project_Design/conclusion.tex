\section{Conclusion}
\noindent
This chapter laid the foundation for the technical and functional understanding of the Intern Management Platform. By outlining the problem, conducting a user journey analysis, identifying system functionalities, and modeling the architecture using UML diagrams, the analytical groundwork was established.

\noindent
This phase not only clarified user needs but also guided design choices that ensured alignment with business goals and technical feasibility. The next chapter will delve into the practical implementation of these components, covering the architecture setup, technologies used, integration strategies, and component development.
