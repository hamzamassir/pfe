\subsection{Project Deployment}
\noindent
The deployment of the Candidate Platform was streamlined through an automated CI/CD pipeline integrated with Bitbucket. The deployment process is triggered automatically upon each tagged commit, ensuring consistent and reliable releases. The production environment leverages containerized services with Traefik handling SSL certificate management and load balancing, while Nginx serves as a reverse proxy for the frontend application.

\subsubsection{Production Architecture Overview}
The production environment implements a multi-layered architecture designed for scalability, security, and performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{External User Layer}: Users access the platform through standard HTTP/HTTPS requests via web browsers to the public domain.
    
    \item \textbf{Edge Router (Traefik)}: Acts as the primary entry point, performing SSL termination using Let's Encrypt certificates and implementing container-based routing rules to direct traffic to appropriate services.
    
    \item \textbf{Reverse Proxy (Nginx)}: Handles request caching and forwards uncached requests to the Next.js frontend container, optimizing response times for static content.
    
    \item \textbf{Frontend Application (Next.js)}: Serves the user interface, rendering static pages and managing client-side interactions while communicating with the backend through JSON:API endpoints.
    
    \item \textbf{Backend API (Drupal)}: Processes business logic, handles authentication, and manages data operations through a headless CMS architecture.
    
    \item \textbf{Database Layer (MySQL)}: Provides persistent data storage and retrieval for all application data and user information.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Optimization Strategy}
To ensure optimal performance and minimal latency, the platform implements a multi-tier caching strategy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Caching (Redis)}: The frontend container utilizes Redis as a high-performance key-value store for user sessions and temporary application state, reducing authentication overhead.
    
    \item \textbf{Backend Caching (Memcached)}: The backend container employs Memcached to cache database query results, significantly reducing database load and improving response times for frequently accessed data.
    
    \item \textbf{Caching Layer Separation}: Redis and Memcached operate independently, serving distinct optimization purposes - frontend user experience optimization versus backend data access optimization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\noindent
The Candidate Platform has successfully transformed VOID Digital Agency's intern recruitment process into a more efficient, transparent, and scalable system. Through the implementation of automated workflows, structured evaluation processes, and clear communication channels, the platform has significantly enhanced the overall recruitment experience for both candidates and recruiters. The robust production architecture ensures reliable performance, security, and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and scaling requirements.
