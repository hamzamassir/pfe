I, \textbf{Hamza Massir}, born on 2001-12-31 in Casablanca, Morocco, am a final-year student at the National School of Applied Sciences (ENSAM) in Casablanca, Morocco. I am currently pursuing a State Engineering's degree (5 years) in Software Engineering.
I am writing to confirm that I have completed all the necessary coursework and requirements for my State Engineering's degree. I have successfully passed all the required exams and practical projects, demonstrating my proficiency in software engineering principles and practices.
I am currently in the process of completing my final project, which is a comprehensive software development project that showcases my skills and knowledge in the field. \textbf{I am expected to graduate in July 2024, and I will receive my State Engineering's degree upon successful completion of this project.}
